Assignment Title: Data Engineering Case Study

Imagine you are a data engineer working for AdvertiseX, a digital advertising technology company. AdvertiseX specializes in programmatic advertising and manages multiple online advertising campaigns for its clients. The company handles vast amounts of data generated by ad impressions, clicks, conversions, and more. Your role as a data engineer is to address the following challenges:

Data Ingestion:

We can utilize Apache Kafka as a scalable and high-performance streaming platform to ingest and process the data. Kafka can handle high volumes of data and can be easily scaled out.

We can create separate Kafka topics for ad impressions, clicks/conversions, and bid requests. Each topic can be configured with appropriate partitions and replication factors to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.

Data Processing:

To process and enrich the data, we can use Apache Spark, a powerful and flexible data processing engine. Spark can handle structured and semi-structured data formats like JSON, CSV, and Avro.

We can create Spark Streaming jobs to consume data from Kafka topics and perform transformations on the fly. The jobs can be configured to handle late-arriving data, data deduplication, and data validation.

To correlate ad impressions with clicks and conversions, we can use Spark's Window Functions and Join operations. Window functions can be used to group data by time windows, while join operations can be used to correlate the data.

Data Storage and Query Performance:

To store the processed data efficiently and enable fast querying, we can use Apache Cassandra, a highly scalable and distributed NoSQL database. Cassandra can handle large amounts of data and can be easily scaled out.

We can create tables in Cassandra to store the processed data, with appropriate primary keys and clustering keys to enable efficient querying and aggregations.

To optimize the storage system for analytical queries and aggregations, we can use Apache Druid, an open-source, high-performance analytics data store. Druid can handle large amounts of data and can be easily scaled out.

Error Handling and Monitoring:

To detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays, we can use Apache Flink, a powerful and flexible data processing engine. Flink can handle unbounded and bounded data streams and can be easily scaled out.

We can create Flink jobs to monitor the data ingestion, processing, and storage systems. The jobs can be configured to detect data anomalies, discrepancies, or delays, and can be used to trigger alerting mechanisms.

By following this approach, we can design a robust and scalable data engineering solution that addresses the specific data processing and analysis needs of AdvertiseX. The solution can handle high volumes of data, enrich the data with meaningful insights, and provide fast querying capabilities for campaign performance analysis.
